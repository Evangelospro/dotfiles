### Burp
#### Installation and updates
Burp is setup to auto update with the update zsh function above. As I like to use the jar file with my own loaders for obvious reasons, the latest jar file is fetched and placed in $HOME/.config/Burp/Burp-Loader and symlinked to burpsuite_pro.jar
#### Config
- [project-options.json](dot_config/Burp/project-options.json)
- [user-options.json](dot_config/Burp/user-options.json)
### IDA [DockerWineIDA](https://github.com/NyaMisty/docker-wine-ida)
IDA essentially runs in docker(running xfce and wine) and rdesktop auto connects
It can be started via the IDA [desktop file](dot_local/private_share/private_applications/burp.desktop) it can be launched from the launcher
### Android Emulator
A setup android emulator can be started from the launcher using the [android_emulator](dot_local/private_share/private_applications/android-emulator.desktop) desktop file

## Custom Arch Linux ISO with AUR packages batteries included
### Ways to get the ISO
#### From the releases tab (automated builds)
##### Two self-explainatory isos (full and light)
[![full version](https://github.com/BallowTK/dotfiles/actions/workflows/buildISO-full.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BallowTK/dotfiles/actions/workflows/buildISO-full.yml)
[![light version](https://github.com/BallowTK/dotfiles/actions/workflows/buildISO-light.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BallowTK/dotfiles/actions/workflows/buildISO-light.yml)
##### Oneliner that gets you a ready-to-use iso with my dotfiles and packages
```
curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BallowTK/dotfiles/main/iso/get-iso.sh|bash
```
#### Manual download and verification
##### 1) Download all the files from the latest release
##### 2) Verify each part's sha256sum(all should return OK)
```
sha256sum --check *.part*.sha256
```
##### 3) Merge the parts together to get the iso
```
iso_name=$(\ls | grep -E '^ELARCH-*.iso.sha256$' | sed 's/.sha256//')
cat $(\ls | grep -E '^ELARCH-.*\.part[^.]*$') > $iso_name
```
##### 4) Verify the combined sha256sum
```
sha256sum --check $iso_name.sha256
```
### Manual Build
```
cd iso
./build.sh
```

## Installation and Usage
### WARNING: The dotfiles are applied differently on the iso based on the hostanme `ELARCH-ISO`, so **whatever you do dont' change or set the hostname to** `ELARCH-ISO` or `ELARCH-F15`(as this applies some extra configs that are very specific to me and my own hardware etc...), during or after the installation! But again **I really, really recommend that you fork this repo and edit the files** to your liking before applying them!!!
### 1) [Download](#ways-to-get-the-iso) the iso and flash it to a usb drive
### 2) Default user is `liveuser` and password is `liveuser` sign in with these and wait for the iso to finish the initial downloads
### 3) A nice calamares installer is also included to guide you through the installation process, in case it didn't start automatically using the launcher shortcut from [above](#launch--reload-applications), you can start it manually by searching `install system` in the launcher or by running `sudo calamares -d` in a terminal, which will also give you some debug info that you should include in an issue if you encounter any problems.
### 4) After the installation is complete, you can login with your just created user and password and enjoy your new system!
