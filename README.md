## Ways to get the ISO
### From the releases tab (automated builds)
## Two self-explainatory isos (full and light)
[![full version](https://github.com/Evangelospro/dotfiles/actions/workflows/buildISO-full.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Evangelospro/dotfiles/actions/workflows/buildISO-full.yml)
[![light version](https://github.com/Evangelospro/dotfiles/actions/workflows/buildISO-light.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Evangelospro/dotfiles/actions/workflows/buildISO-light.yml)
#### Oneliner that gets you a ready-to-use iso with my dotfiles and packages
```
curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Evangelospro/dotfiles/main/iso/get-iso.sh|bash
```
#### Manual download and verification
##### 1) Download all the files from the latest release
##### 2) Verify each part's sha256sum(all should return OK)
```
sha256sum --check *.part*.sha256
```
##### 3) Merge the parts together to get the iso
```
iso_name=$(\ls | grep -E '^ELARCH-*.iso.sha256$' | sed 's/.sha256//')
cat $(\ls | grep -E '^ELARCH-.*\.part[^.]*$') > $iso_name
```
##### 4) Verify the combined sha256sum
```
sha256sum --check $iso_name.sha256
```
### Manual Build
```
cd iso
./build.sh
```

## Installation and Usage
### WARNING: The dotfiles are applied differently on the iso based on the hostanme `ELARCH-ISO`, so **whatever you do dont' change or set the hostname to** `ELARCH-ISO` or `ELARCH-F15`(as this applies some extra configs that are very specific to me and my own hardware etc...), during or after the installation! But again **I really, really recommend that you fork this repo and edit the files** to your liking before applying them!!!
### 1) [Download](#ways-to-get-the-iso) the iso and flash it to a usb drive
### 2) Default user is `liveuser` and password is `liveuser` sign in with these after the iso has finished the initial downloads
### 3) A nice calamares installer is also included to guide you through the installation process, in case it didn't start automatically using the launcher shortcut from [above](#launch--reload-applications), you can start it manually by searching `install system` in the launcher or by running `sudo calamares -d` in a terminal, which will also give you some debug info that you should include in an issue if you encounter any problems.
### 4) After the installation is complete, you can login with your just created user and password and enjoy your new system!
