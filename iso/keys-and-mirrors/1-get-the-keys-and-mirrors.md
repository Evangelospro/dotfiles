We recommend you get the ASA or ArcoLinux Spices Application.

We are sure that it will always work in the future.

We use the tool to turn any Arch Linux system into an ArcoLinux system.

You can install it in a desktop environment or in TTY.

Type "sudo pacman -Syyu" in a terminal to see that our repos are in the list.

Afterwards pacman will recognize the ArcoLinux keys and the ArcoLinux mirrors.

If that is the case you can install the Chaotic keyring and Chaotic mirrorlist.

sudo pacman -S chaotic-keyring chaotic-mirrorlist

Then you can add ArcoLinux and Chaotic packages to your packages list.
