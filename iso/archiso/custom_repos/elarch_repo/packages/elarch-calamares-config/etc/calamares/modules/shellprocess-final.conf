# Configuration for the shell process job.
#
# Executes a list of commands found under the key *script*.
# If the top-level key *dontChroot* is true, then the commands
# are executed in the context of the live system, otherwise
# in the context of the target system. In all of the commands,
# the following variable expansions will take place:
#  - `ROOT` is replaced by the root mount point of the **target**
#    system from the point of view of the command (when run in the target
#    system, e.g. when *dontChroot* is false, that will be `/`).
#  - `USER` is replaced by the username, set on the user page.
#
# Variables are written as `${var}`, e.g. `${ROOT}`.
#
# The (global) timeout for the command list can be set with
# the *timeout* key. The value is a time in seconds, default
# is 30 seconds if not set. The timeout **must** be tuned, either
# globally or per-command (see below in the description of *script*),
# to the load or expected running-time of the command.
#
#  - Setting a timeout of 30 for a `touch` command is probably exessive
#  - Setting a timeout of 1 for a `touch` command might be low,
#    on a slow disk where touch needs to be loaded from CDROM
#  - Setting a timeout of 30 for a 1GB download is definitely low
#  - Setting a timeout of 3600 for a 1GB download is going to leave
#    the user in uncertainty for a loooong time.
#
# If a command starts with "-" (a single minus sign), then the
# return value of the command following the - is ignored; otherwise,
# a failing command will abort the installation. This is much like
# make's use of - in a command.
#
# The value of *script* may be:
#   - a single string; this is one command that is executed.
#   - a single object (this is not useful).
#   - a list of items; these are executed one at a time, by
#     separate shells (/bin/sh -c is invoked for each command).
#     Each list item may be:
#     - a single string; this is one command that is executed.
#     - a single object, specifying a key *command* and (optionally)
#       a key *timeout* to set the timeout for this specific
#       command differently from the global setting.
#
# Using a single object is not useful because the same effect can
# be obtained with a single string and a global timeout, but when
# there are multiple commands to execute, one of them might have
# a different timeout than the others.
#
# To change the description of the job, set the *name* entries in *i18n*.
